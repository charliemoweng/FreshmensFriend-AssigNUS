# FreshmensFriend-AssigNUS

Hi, and welcome to AssigNUS by Freshmen's Friend, an NUS-focused platform for students to plan and manage their tasks.

Functions supported:

1. Input Modules that a student is currently taking;
2. Create Tasks for different Modules, set a deadline and allocate a period for it;
3. Display Tasks created on Calendar. Allow rearranging of Tasks in Calendar;
4. Reminder for users when the deadline of a Task draws close.

This is a web development project for the NUS Orbital programme by Team Freshmen's Friend, comprising of two NUS Year1 CS students, Joseph and Mengzhe. This is the first software development project for both of us.
